# SA-MDPO for Qwen-VL

> Official implementation of  
> **"MAVEN: A Macro-Societal Value Evaluation Framework of Multimodal Content with Compact Aligned Evaluators"**


## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of **SA-MDPO** (Span-Adaptive Multi-level DPO), a rank-gap-aware preference optimization method for distilling macro-societal value-judgment capability from frontier vision-language models into compact student models.

**Key features**:
- ✅ Support for both **Qwen2.5-VL** and **Qwen3-VL** model families
- ✅ Full SA-MDPO / MDPO / DPO training pipelines with LoRA
- ✅ DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 / ZeRO-3 (with offloading) configurations
- ✅ Gradio demo for interactive inference
- ✅ Evaluation on MacroValue-Bench (6 dimensions, 72 indicators)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[anonymous]/SA-MDPO-for-Qwen-vl.git
cd SA-MDPO-for-Qwen-vl

# Create environment from environment.yaml
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate samdpo
```

## Datasets

Benchmark and training set are accessed at [valuedata](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gsNmPKQ951E5ZjKn6yxNBg?pwd=ah8t)



## 🚀 Training

### SA-MDPO Fine-tuning on Qwen3-VL (Recommended)

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_mdpo_qwen3.sh
```

### SA-MDPO Fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-VL

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_mdpo_qwen2_5.sh
```



## 🧪 Evaluation

Evaluate trained models on MacroValue-Bench:

```bash
bash scripts/eval.sh 
```


## 🎨 Interactive Demo

Launch the Gradio demo for interactive value evaluation:

```bash
bash scripts/gradio.sh
```

Then open `http://localhost:7860` in your browser.
